\subsection{Light as an electromagnetic wave}
Light is a electromagnetic wave, which can be derived from the maxwell equations. Its differential equation describes a simple harmonic motion of the field Vector in time and space and results in 
what is called a planar wave function
\begin{equation}
    \vec{E}\left(\vec{x}, t\right) = \vec{E_0} \, \text{exp} \left(i \left(\vec{x} \cdot \vec{k} - \omega t\right)\right)
\end{equation}
where $\vec{k}$ is the direction of propagation and $\omega$ is the frequency of the wave.
For a fixed place, the electromagnetic field reduces to a harmonic oscillation in time given by the function
\begin{equation}
    \vec{E}\left(\vec{x}, t\right) = \vec{E_0} \, \text{cos} \left(\omega t + \delta\right)
\end{equation}
where the place component has bin absorbed into a arbitrary phase shift $\delta$.
