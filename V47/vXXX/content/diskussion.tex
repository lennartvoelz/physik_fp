\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:Diskussion}
In the following, the percentage deviations are calculated with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
    \Delta = |\frac{exp - theo}{theo}|\cdot 100\%.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Heat capacity at constant pressure and constant volume}

The heat capacity at constant pressure $C_p$ and constant volume $C_V$ has been calculated in \autoref{sec:heat_capacity} and \autoref{sec:heat_capacity_vol}. As expected, the heat capacity
at constant pressure is higher than the heat capacity at constant volume. Expected is a $T^3$-dependence of the heat capacity which cannot really be verified with the given data because the 
uncertainties in the initial values for the resistors are amplified by the calculation of the temperature and thus lead to a high uncertainty in the heat capacity. 
Furthermore, there are some outliers in the data which could be caused by a significant temperature difference between the shield and the copper sample. Even though it is tried to minimize this
effect by constantly adjusting the power supply to heat the shield to the same temperature as the copper sample, it is not possible to completely eliminate this effect.\\
Only one reference value for the heat capacity at constant pressure could be found \cite{c_p} at room temperature. The value is $C_p = \SI{24.47}{\joule/\mol\kelvin}$ which is in the range of the
measured values.\\

\subsection{Debye temperature}
The Debye temperature was calculated from the measured data aswell as from a theoretical point of view. The theoretical value is $\theta_D = \SI{332.63}{\kelvin}$ and the from the measurement 
constructed value is $\theta_D = \SI{303.35(1.79)}{\kelvin}$. The percentage deviation is calculated with \autoref{eq:1} and is $\Delta = 8.77\%$. The theoretical value is not within the
uncertainty of the measured value. This could be caused by the effects mentioned in the previous section.\\
Since the experimental value is in the range of the theoretical value, the Debye model can nevertheless be considered as valid for the copper sample.\\
